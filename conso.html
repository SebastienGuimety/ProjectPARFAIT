<p>The Laboratoire Informatique d’Avignon (LIA) belongs to the Université d’Avignon et des Pays de Vaucluse (UAPV). 
The LIA is the computer science laboratory of the University of Avignon. It covers three areas: Networking, Oral and Text Language Processing and Operational Research. 
LIA has a large experience on participation and management of cooperative projects. 
This is shown by its implication in many European projects and networks of excellence (CONGAS, BIONETS, SMADA, Divines, PASCAL, BioSecure, HARTES), as on national projects (Ecoscells, Winem, BIO_MUL, SIGMUND, CLADIS, BIOBIMO, FP7 Congas, Idefix). 
LIA also has many industrial collaborations. One goal of the Networking group is to explore the applications of game theory and queuing theory to analyze, design, and assess the performance of networks. 
The objective is to study the best practices in modelling and design tool for networks. Both the application of game theory to networking problems and the development of new game-
theoretic methodologies that can be applied in that context are part of our interest. <br>

<p >Public science and technology institution established in 1967, Inria is the only public research body fully dedicated to computational sciences. 
    Inria is represented by two teams. Agora (leaded by Hervé Rivano and including Razvan Stanica) is located in the CITI laboratory of Insa Lyon. The team
    focuses on the deployment, optimization and protocols for wireless networks, in particular applied to smart cities scenarios. 
    Maestro (including Eitan Altman) is part of the Sophia Antipolis Méditerranée Inria research center. 
    The project-team is concerned with the modeling, performance evaluation, optimization and control of stochastic discrete-event dynamical systems, with a particular emphasis on networks and their applications. 
    Inria will bring its expertise on economic modeling and smart cities.<br>
    Inria participants: Hérvé Rivano (PI), Altman Eitan, Stanica Razvan.

<p >The Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers is a doctoral degree-granting education establishment and Grande Ecole in engineering dedicated to providing education and conducting research for the promotion of science and industry. 
    Its computer science and communications department CEDRIC is internationally recognized as a leading research institute. CNAM participate with members from its novel ROC research team. 
    The involved members have a long experience in both national and international collaborative research projects. 
    CNAM will contribute on multi-resource allocation, virtual network management and orchestration algorithms, as well as analytical modeling and performance evaluation.<br>

<p >Savoy Mont Blanc University (French: Université Savoie Mont Blanc, a.k.a. Chambéry University) is a public university in the region of Savoy, with one campus in Annecy and two around Chambéry.
    The university was officially founded in 1979 from several colleges founded in the 1960s and 1970s. 
    To avoid a straight choice between the two biggest towns of the Savoie/Haute-Savoie region, the authorities decided to set up a campus in each city for different areas of study. 
    The university has three campuses:
