<p>The Laboratoire Informatique d’Avignon (LIA) is the computer science laboratory of the University of Avignon.
    LIA has a large experience on participation and management of cooperative projects and it is implicated in both European projects and national projects, as well as in several industrial collaborations.
    The lab coordinates the PARFAIT project as Cornet,, the group focusing on Complex systems, Operations Research and NETworking.
    One goal of the Cornet group is to explore the application of game theory and optimization theory to analyze, design, and assess the performance of networks and resources allocation therein.
    The objective is to contribute to the best practices in modeling and design toolsfor networks.
    In the project, LIA contributes on stochastic approximations and reinforcement learning with application to edge and fog computing. <br>
    Participants: Francesco de Pellegrini and Rachid El Azouzi.

<p >Public science and technology institution established in 1967, Inria is the only public research body fully dedicated to computational sciences.
    Inria is represented by two teams. Agora (leaded by Hervé Rivano and including Razvan Stanica) is located in the CITI laboratory of Insa Lyon. 
    The team focuses on the deployment, optimization and protocols for wireless networks, in particular applied to smart cities scenarios. Maestro (including Eitan Altman) is part of the Sophia Antipolis Méditerranée Inria research center. 
    The project-team is concerned with the modeling, performance evaluation, optimization and control of stochastic discrete-event dynamical systems, with a particular emphasis on networks and their applications. It contributes to the project with outstanding theoretical competences in game theory, stochastic games, and Markov Decision theory.<br>
    Participants: Eitan Altman and Konstantin Avratchenkov.

<p >The Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers is a doctoral degree-granting education establishment and Grande Ecole in engineering dedicated to providing education and conducting research for the promotion of science and industry. 
    Its computer science and communications department CEDRIC is internationally recognized as a leading research institute. CNAM participate with members from its novel ROC research team. The involved members have a long experience in both national and international collaborative research projects. 
    rings world- class expertise on Mobile Edge Cloud orchestration, platforms and protocols, and IoT, and contributes to the definition of the reference architecture considered in PARFAIT.<br>
    Participants: Françoise Sailhan, Eric Gressier-Soudan and Stefano Secci.

<p >The Laboratoire d'Informatique, Systèmes, Traitement de l'Information et de la Connaissance (LISTIC) is a Research Unit of the Savoie Mont Blanc University (USMB). 
    Its scientific project focuses on machine learning and information fusion as well as networks and systems. 
    The networks and systems group at LISTIC is specialized in network systems, network modeling, and Internet measurement. 
    The group has recognized competences on system research and has routinely participated in national and international research projects using research network testbeds. 
    LISTIC will coordinate the development of the evaluation platforms used to validate the output of the project. <br>
    Participants: Francesco Bronzino and Kavé Salamatian.
